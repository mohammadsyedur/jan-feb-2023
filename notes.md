* Install JDK from Oracle (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
* Java v19
* You get a new release of Java every 6 months
* java 1.8 is a major release in the java world __(Lambda expressions, functional style of coding)__
* 1.8, 11, 15, 17
* If you use 1.8 and write code and compile using java 17, it works perfectly fine. But the reverse is not true.

### Writing code in Java

* All the code is written in __.java__ file
* Every .java file SHOULD have ONLY one __public class__
* The name of the public class SHOULD be the name of the file
* eg., public class Person{}, the name of the file should be Person.java
* eg., public class Cat {}, the name of the file should be Cat.java 
* The main function should be inside a __public class__

* All classNames start with UpperCase; Hence all filenames also begin with UpperCase; 
* Convention is one public class per .java file. And essentially one class per .java file
* The starting point of any Java application, __public static void main(String[] args)__
